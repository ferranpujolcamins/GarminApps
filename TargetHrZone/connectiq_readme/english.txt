A data field that displays the current workout step target heart rate, in beats per minute.

When the target is a heart rate zone, the data field displays the heart rate corresponding to the middle of the zone.
For example, if the target is zone 2 and your zone 2 goes from 130 to 150 bpm, the data field will display 140.

When the target is specified as a low and high heart rate limits, the data field displays the average of both values.
For example, if the target is to be between 140 and 180 bpm, the data field will display 160.

When there's no active workout or the current workout step target is not heart rate, the data field displays "--".
